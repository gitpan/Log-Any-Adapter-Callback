NAME
    Log::Any::Adapter::Callback - Send Log::Any logs to a subroutine

VERSION
    version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
     use Log::Any::Adapter;
     Log::Any::Adapter->set('Callback',
         logging_cb   => sub { ... },
         detection_cb => sub { ... }, # optional, default is: sub { 1 }
     );

DESCRIPTION
    This adapter lets you specify callback subroutine to be called by
    Log::Any's logging methods (like $log->debug(), $log->error(), etc) and
    detection methods (like $log->is_warning(), $log->is_fatal(), etc.).

    This is mostly a convenient construct and saves a few lines of code,
    because so you don't have to create a full Log::Any adapter class.

    Your logging callback subroutine will be called with these arguments:

     ($method, $self, $format, @params)

    where $method is the name of method (like "debug") and ($self, $format,
    @params) are given by Log::Any.
